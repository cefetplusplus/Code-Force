## Knowledge Used
* stl (set,vector and pair)
* sort
* cartesian plane

## Problem
You are given an array a of n integers a1,a2,…,an.

Your task is to response to the queries like "How many numbers' values are between l and r?".

#### Input
* The first line of the input contains n — the length of the array $(1≤n≤10^5)$.
* The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an $(−10^9≤ai≤10^9)$.
* The third line contains integer k — the number of queries $(1≤k≤10^5)$.
* The following k lines contain a pair of integers l r — query, described above $(−10^9≤l≤r≤10^9)$.

#### Output
The output must consist of k integers — responses for the queries.
