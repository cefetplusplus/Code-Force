## Problem
There are n ropes, you need to cut k pieces of the same length from them. Find the maximum length of pieces you can get.

#### Input
The first line contains two integers n and k (1≤n,k≤10000). Next n lines contain one number each, the length of the rope ai $(1≤ai≤10^7)$.

#### Output
Output one real number, maximum length of pieces you can get. The answer will be considered correct if the relative or absolute error does not exceed $10^{−6}$.
